Lab 6
Objective: Explore generative models and network properties

Generate:
1. Create artificial graphs
2. Plot degree distribution (log log scale)
3. Compute average shortest path and clustering coefficient


Expected Output:
1. Image of artificial graphs plotted with degree distribution
2. Comparison table of metrics
